Features: 
1. Efficient for sorting a small number of elements

Procedures:
1. 

Pseudocode: INSERTION_SORT
for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    i = j - 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] > key
        A[i+1] = A[i]
        i = i-1
    A[i+1] = key
    
LOOP INVARIANR: 
At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 1-8, the subarray A[1..j-1] 
consists of the elements originally in A[1..j-1], but in sorted order.
